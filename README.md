I build mobile apps (iOS and Android) for the educational market at Thinkamingo. I recently built signal processing / satellite comms for Miles Space. I serve as Vice President and on the board of directors for a non-profit makerspace, Tampa Hackerspace, where I also build some infrastructure applications.
